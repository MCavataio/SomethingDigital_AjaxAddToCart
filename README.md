Events Fired through JS
--
**sd_ajaxaddtocart:success**

After a product is successfully added to the cart, a success event called `sd_ajaxaddtocart:success` is fired. It is easy to hook into this with jQuery. An example of listening for the event and firing a notification using [jGrowl](https://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl):

```
  $j(document).bind( "sd_ajaxaddtocart:success", function(e, data) {
    $j.jGrowl(data.message, { sticky: true, header: 'Added to Basket', footer: '<a href="<?php echo Mage::getBaseUrl() ?>checkout/cart" class="button--secondary">Go to basket</a>' });
  });
```

**sd_ajaxaddtocart:failure**

If a product can not be successfully added to the cart, a failure event called `sd_ajaxaddtocart:failure` is fired.
